An overkill project that I created in order to showcase my skills.
It consumes a Micro-Services API built in Lumen for fetching the Projects and a Node/Express API for Blog Items.
## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Config.**
    
    Set the env variables for the 2 API 
    
    ```sh
    /.env.production
    /.env.development
    ```
    
    Or replace the Project and Blog graphQL queries with your static content
    
    ```sh 
    ./src/components/containers/Blog/Blog.js
    ./src/components/containers/Skills/Skills.js
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```
   
3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
